I spent endless nights working alongside Nico throughtout our Bachelor's study in Computer Science.
Fortunate are those who found such a healthy friendship as the one I have with him.
Nowadays, Nicol√≤ is enrolled in a _Master of Science in Management, Technology, and Economics_ at ETH Zurich.
His interests concern management, entrepeneurship and technology.
If a startup idea crossed your mind I suggest to have a chat with him to get some feedback!
